# The Last Ember

You awaken beside the faint glow of a dying ember — the last warmth left in a world long gone cold. The forest is silent. The air tastes of ash. Keep the ember alive.

## Core Loop

- Spend hours each day to gather, hunt, rest, explore, tend the fire, or make an offering.
- Survive as many days as you can. When you die, the ember remains.
- Your experience and knowledge are absorbed by the ember. On the next run, you wake again — but the ember remembers more.
- The Knowledge Tree represents memories passed on between lives.

## Offerings

Relics of the old world (artifacts) can be offered to the ember:

- Immediate effect: +4 fire, +1 rest (1-day cooldown)
- Narrative: The ember responds — it flares, and fragments of memory surface
- Future hooks: Certain offerings can unlock knowledge or alter the world

## Themes

- Decay and Rebirth: Hope and memory persist through ruin
- Cycle of Lives: Each run is a new wanderer drawn to the ember
- Choice and Faith: Offerings strengthen the ember… but at what cost?
- Forgotten World: Reveal fragments of the old civilization through events and items

## Example Progression

- Early Days: cold, desperate survival — "The forest is silent, your breath sharp in the air."
- Mid Game: discovery and mystery — "The ember hums when you hold a stone etched with sigils."
- End Game: knowledge, power, choice — "The ember blazes bright. A voice speaks your name."

## Accessibility and Notes

- Knowledge can be toggled in the Knowledge Tree page and now applies mid-run via live sync.
- Explore guarantees a story beat; other actions may surface flavor.
- Inventory uses wood, meat, berries, and artifacts (relics).
